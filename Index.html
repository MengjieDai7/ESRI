    <p>My introduction to ESRI products began in 2019 when I was introduced to the world of GIS for the first time as an undergraduate at McMaster University. I was originally a biology major and began my pivot into 
      GIS when I realized how much I enjoyed this field. Before long, I came to the realization that I devoted more time to my geography electives than to my biology courses. While my interest in GIS started late in third year, I 
      quickly adjusted my schedule and graduated with a minor in GIS. </p>
    

    <p>I continued my interest in GIS during my graduate degree. While I was completing a Global Health degree, I came to the realization that I was examining problems with a geospatial mindset. From the last mile problem with vaccine delivery, to the 
      tracking of the sustainable development goals, or to the creation of a new safe injection site in Waterloo, I was considering all the ways that GIS was able to aid in creating solutions.
      While I was completing my international practicum at the Joint Clinical Research Centre in Uganda, I saw how this organization was trying to integrate GIS into their own services. They were beginning to utilize their ESRI liscenses and in the process of organizing GIS staff training sessions. 
      This experience made me realize how impactful ESRI is on a global scale. </p>
